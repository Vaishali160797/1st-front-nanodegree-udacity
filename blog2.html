                <p>C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.
                    <br>C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.
                    <br>C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.
                    <br>The language was updated 3 major times in 2011, 2014, and 2017 to C++11, C++14, and C++17.

                <br><h3>Why Use C++</h3>
                C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.<br>
                C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.<br>
                C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
                <br>C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.
                <br>C++ is fun and easy to learn!
                <br>As C++ is close to C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa

                        <h3>About</h3>
                        <p>The C++ programming language has a history going back to 1979, when Bjarne Stroustrup was
                             doing work for his Ph.D. thesis. One of the languages Stroustrup had the opportunity
                              to work with was a language called Simula, which as the name implies is a language
                               primarily designed for simulations. The Simula 67 language - which was the variant 
                               that Stroustrup worked with - is regarded as the first language to support the object-oriented 
                               programming paradigm.</p>
